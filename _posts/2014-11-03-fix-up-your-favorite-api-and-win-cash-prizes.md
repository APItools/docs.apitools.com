Fix your favorite API or make it even more awesome. Your favorite APIs likely have some quirks and anomalies which trip you up or are though to get started with. And even though you love them, a way to patch them would sometimes be nice. Well, now you can. And you can win prizes for doing it. Anything is valid! Just bring together your API wisdom, your Lua skills and bit of creativity and inspiration.

At APItools we <3 APIs, we think they are an enabler for new and more simple ways of developing software, consuming data, and integrating systems. We also think there’s a long way to go till integrating with APIs is a piece of a cake. So that’s what we want to help make happen!

 Get started with our competition (starting today!) creating a middleware module, sharing it in APItools public middleware repository on Github, and win $1,000 (first prize).
