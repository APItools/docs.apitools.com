Today we’re excited to announce APItools On-Premise so you can run it wherever you like. What’s even better is that the code is open-source so you can see all the moving parts + even tweak it yourself. Both of these things were part of our big long-term plans but so many people asked, we decided to make it happen as soon as we could!

### How Is APItools On-Premise Different?

The previous version of APItools was only available as a cloud hosted solution. This new version allows you to combine cloud monitors with on-premise and integrate monitoring into API traffic wherever you wish – creating the perfect tool to manage external dependencies on APIs. 

The cloud-hosted version of APItools is rate limited to 30 requests per second on a heavily containerized, not especially powerful, server. With APItools On-Premise, and a server powerful enough to run a container/virtual box at full speed, you’ll  see more requests per second - especially if it's in the same network as your API server. You also won't have roundtrips or additional latency in the traffic flow.

### Get Overall Insights

The APItools dashboard offers overall insights and key indicators, including:

> All your external and internal API dependencies.

> All your web and mobile apps.

> All your test and production environments.

> Just. One. Site.

Also, different API traffic monitors can be created for different apps and development environments, and can be shared by multiple team members. 

### Run It Without The Cloud

Connecting the monitors you run locally to your main APItools account gives you lots of goodness – but in some cases you might not be able to do it, so it can also run in a completely disconnected mode. 

There’s also a mode to report stats anonymously. This is helpful for our team to see how things are working and in the long run we hope to share real time traffic data from many APIs.

### … And It’s Open-Source. Woot!

Of course we want it to be flexible so you can manipulate your own setup, but we also believe that truly allowing the community to contribute is essential for a top-notch product.

So, following the 3scale API management platform path, APItools On-Premise is being made available as open-source (using  the MIT license) and can be found on Github:

###  [https://github.com/APItools/monitor](https://github.com/APItools/monitor 'APItools on Github')

Wait, there’s more. **We’re giving away 10 exclusive APItools t-shirts** to the first who report a bug, patch or enhancement that gets approved!

### Request An Invite For The BETA

APItools is still in private beta, [so request an invite for the BETA here](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools private beta invite').

But if  you already have an APItools account, you can download and install APItools locally from your dashboard.

Thank you, and you, and you… and you too (you all know who you are), for helping to provide a genuinely useful service.
