Last Friday we had some fun playing with API movie titles. We actually spontaneously started with this on Thursday night at [3scale](http://3scale.net '3scale') and decided to share the next day to see what other API lovers would come up with :-) The result is pretty sweet.

In case you missed it, here's a [compilation of #apimovietitle tweets](http://www.3scale.net/2014/08/twitter-gets-creative-apimovietitles/) published on the 3scale blog.

You can also search for [#apimovietitles](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=apimovietitles '#apimovietitles') on Twitter.

Happy start of the week!
