<img src="/images/summer-music-festival-michaelspencer.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" width="400px;"> Summer wouldn’t be the same without summer festivals. Music and tech get on very well and it is no news that really cool things usually come out of the union of the two (incredible sound and music devices, artists who use tech to create music in a whole new different way, a bazillion cool music apps, etc.).

In addition to that, with most of the population owning a smart phone and being all over social networks, music festivals are also changing in regards to tech and APIs. How? They are becoming more interested in exposing their data for developers to be able to create apps. And here are two powerful reasons why:  

- Enhancing the festival experience (real time apps showing concerts going on, meeting new people, meeting points, food and drinks, etc.)
- Helping promote the event (photo and video sharing during the event, create hype before and during the event, etc).

#### Music And Event APIs
There are generic event APIs, as for example [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/ 'Evernote') or [Eventful](http://api.eventful.com/ 'Eventful'), which expose data such as name of the event, description, date and location. Then there are music specific APIs which go one step further and expose information about festivals and artists taking part in those (bands, albums, songs, etc): [Sognkick](http://www.songkick.com/developer 'Songkick'), [5gig](http://www.nvivo.es/api/ '5gig'), [Spotify](https://partners.spotify.com/how-to-guides/festivals/ 'Spotify and music festivals'). 

And finally, there are festivals going even further which have their own APIs and expose data about the festival itself: bands schedule, other events happening organized by the audience, camp and accommodation listings, etc. 

We dug a bit more into the latter and put together this list with some cool initiatives for you to check out.

#### Music Festival APIs And Hackathons

-	[Music Hack Day @ Sónar](http://sonarplusd.com/activity/music-hack-day-2015/ 'Music Hack Day @ Sónar') (Barcelona, Spain). Just last weekend the fifth edition of the Music Hack day took place in Barcelona during the Sónar music festival. Check out all the [cool things that happened there](http://musichackday.upf.edu/mhd/2015/)! 
-	[Roskilde Festival APIs](https://www.facebook.com/RoskildeLabs/posts/207026509332141 'Roskilde APIs') (Roskilde, Denmark). June, 27 - July 4th. They offer access to the band schedule and to events organized by the audience via two differnet XML feeds. However, they are looking into providing better access to event data and are accepting requests and ideas on their Facebook page.
-	[Outside Hacks](http://www.outsidehacks.com/ 'OutsideH acks') (San Francisco, CA). July 11-12. The goal of this hackahton is to enhance the [festival](http://www.sfoutsidelands.com/ 'Outside Lands') experience for attendees, artists, or fans not being able to attend the festival.
-	[Tomorrowland API](http://www.nascom.be/work/api-and-drupal-based-web-platform-tomorrowland 'Tomorrowland API and Web Platform') (Boom, Belgium). July, 24-25-26. This [massive electronic music festival](http://www.tomorrowland.com/home 'Tomorrowland festival') API enables enthusiastic fans and partners to integrate Tomorrowland and TomorrowWorld data into their own apps.
-	[Burning Man APIs](http://innovate.burningman.org/apis-page/ 'Burning Man APIs') (Black Rock City, NV). August- September. Burning Man currently offers 5 different APIs: art, campgrounds, Playa events, media gallery, and regional event calendar. All thanks to a great community and volunteers who help create and maintain Burning Man's APIs.
-	[SXSW Music Hackathon](http://www.sxsw.com/music/hackathon 'SXSW Music Hackathon') (Austin, TX) Happening in March. It is a no brainer that an event like SXSW, which is all about film, music and tech, had to have a hackahton. 
-	[Hackaroo](http://www.bonnaroo.com/news-tags/hackathon 'Hackaroo'). Happening in June. This is the hackahton of the Bonaroo Music and Arts Festival. They've partnered with Spotify and Intellitix to offer Live Click Stations - where visitors can automatically post the set they were watching to their social media channels, in the form of a Spotify playlist - and they also host their own hackathon.

Happy summer and happy hacking everyone!
