It seems like it was yesterday when we started fantasizing with the idea of APItools and after only a few months, we were already announcing its private beta: in April 2014 APItools saw the light for the first time.

Only a month later we launched APItools On-Premise - which had been requested by quite a few of our initial group of trusted testers. This allowed developers using APItools to:

-	Running APItools locally
-	Better integrate with existing company workflows and monitoring systems
-	Dealing with high volumes of traffic

And the on-premise version didn’t come alone. Following the path of the [3scale API Management Platform](https://github.com/3scale/ '3scale API Management Platform') and our company philosophy, we open sourced [APItools’ traffic monitor](https://github.com/apitools/monitor 'APItools traffic monitor') under the MIT license.

During the next 6 months, and although being a fairly small team, we managed to make some noise around and send our little elves to evangelize APItools to a lot of places:

In August one of the most powerful features of APItools was released: the sharing middleware platform. APItools middleware combined with APIs offers endless possibilities: 

- Authentication
- Grabbing a photo from [Instagram](https://www.apitools.com/apis/instagram 'Instagram API on APItools'), resizing with [6px API](https://www.apitools.com/apis/6px '6px API on APItools') and saving on [Dropbox](https://www.apitools.com/apis/dropbox 'Dropbox API on APItools').
- Creating email alerts, Slack / [Hipchat](https://www.apitools.com/apis/hipchat 'Hipchat API on APItools') / [insert-your-favorite-messaging-service-here] alerts, and even open issues on [Github](https://www.apitools.com/apis/github 'Github API on APItools') / Bitbucket when something goes wrong.
- Enhancing your favorite music API by adding playable information - A.K.A [Spotify](https://www.apitools.com/apis/spotify-web 'Spotify API on APItools').and / or iTunes ids - to any response.
- Retrieving an email address from a Twitter id, or a Yelp id, or any other social network id for that matter, using [FullContact](https://www.apitools.com/apis/fullcontact 'FullContact APIs on APItools') API.
- ... and whatever you can imagine!

The nice thing about APItools middleware is that anyone can create middleware modules, share them on the [public repository on Github](https://github.com/apitools/middleware 'APItools public middleware repo on Github') and they'll be automatically included in our collection on APItools.

As part of our mission to make it easier to use APIs this last quarter we launched the [API pages](http://apitools.com/apis 'APItools API pages'). These are not so much a discovery tool but a place where to go to find all sorts of information about an API – base urls, documentation links, support and forum links, contact information - including APItools middleware modules which can be shared and reused.

In November, we also organized the very first APItools middleware contest with over 50 participants and $1,500 given in cash prizes. If you missed it, there’s still time to participate. We are extending the contest in the ‘middleware-app category’. [Find out more](https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2014/12/16/extending-our-middleware-contest-until-jan-19-in-the-category-of-middleware-app.html) and submit before January 19th.

Today almost a thousand companies and individuals use APItools to integrate with external and internal API services and monitor what goes on between their apps and those APIs. Thank YOU for so much love!

Thank you for your feedback, you know who you are, and you and YOU. Thank you for trusting us and for being sometimes harsh but always honest – really, thanks for that! Thank you for helping us providing a genuinely useful service. We hope to give back more and more next year, and the years to come!
