More and more apps are becoming dependant on more and more APIs every day. Cloud infrastructures and *backends* as a service are amazing and they're enabling better and more efficient development workflows, but it is also a reality that there's a need for new tools and services to help dev teams integrating their own systems with external platforms, APIs, etc. As a consequence, new products - like [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools') - are blooming. What for? Basically, to make devevelopers lives easier :-)

Mobile development is heavily affected by this scenario, and this Saturday 10/11 [Nicolas Grenié](https://twitter.com/picsoung 'Nicolas Grenié'), 3scale’s Hacker in Residence, will be at [Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/ 'Silicon Valley Code Camp') talking about mobile development, APIs, and sharing some pro tips and tools to help you with API mobile app-driven development.

Here’re some of the main topics Nicolas will cover in his talk:

- Debugging iOS apps (and setting a nice and visual environment on your computer)
- Reducing the payload of your mobile apps
- Caching responses to avoid rate limits
- Transforming data formats on the fly

The Silicon Valley Code Camp is a great event organized by volunteers, and not only full of interesting workshops and hands-on sessions, but also a lot of energy. In addition, if you are in the Bay Area and you haven’t met Nicolas yet (you will soon, no worries, there’s a big chance you run into him at a hackathon or at a developer event) this is a good opportunity to do so! You can also say hi to him on Twitter: [@picsoung](https://twitter.com/picsoung '@picsoung').
