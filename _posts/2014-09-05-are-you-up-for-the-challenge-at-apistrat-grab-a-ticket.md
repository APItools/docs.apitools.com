In approximately a couple of weeks we’ll be at the [API Strategy & Practice Conference in Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php 'API Strategy & Practice Conference in Chicago'). If you’re not familiar with the event, it is an API vendor neutral conference about APIs co-organized by [3scale](http://www.3scale.net/ '3scale') and Kin Lane ([API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com/ 'API Evangelist')). This year for the first time a new developer track and a ‘Speed Hack Challenge’ have been introduced.

### A Speed Hack What?
The Speed Hack Challenge will pit participating teams of developers against a set of tough, strictly time-limited coding challenges. [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools') will dare participants with a challenge as well, and [Enrique](https://twitter.com/otikik 'Enrique') from our team will be there to help you solve all the questions you may have.

To learn more about the challenges and to get started with the APIs participating in the contest (recommended to do so!), [visit the official website of the event](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/speed_hack_challenge.php 'Speed Hack Challenge at APIStrat').

### Agenda
On Thursday, Sept. 24th all the API providers participating in the challenge – and a few more! – will be sharing interesting experiences on how to wrangle their APIs and learn best practice in API driven app development. 

Enrique will talk about Lua, a tiny language born in Brazil which grew as a videogame scripting language, but it is gradually being adppted in other fields at great speed. You will get a taste of the language and see some of its current uses, including APItools.

The hack challenge will be held on Friday morning, and make sure you don’t leave APIStrat before the prizes to the winners are given in the afternoon.

### Grab A Ticket!
If you want to attend the full conference, [today is the last day to get mid price tickets](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php 'APIStrat mid price tickets'). Developer tickets are $99 if you’re only planning on attending the Developer Track and the ‘Speed Hack Challenge’.

We hope to see you in Chicago!
