This blog post is about a very cool app which uses [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools') and how it made my day when I first learned about its existence. There is nothing more exciting than getting an email from a user explaining how they use your technology and why they love it (or what they don’t like!). I am not lying when I say that, as a product manager, interaction with the real world - OMG someone is actually using our app! – is, at the same time, one of the most challenging but also fulfilling parts of my job.

When Rai first got Bernat’s message saying ‘Hey, love what you guys are doing!’ we were obviously happy to to hear that. We also wanted to know more. When I got a second email from Bernat explaining what they are actually doing with APItools, we-were-pumped. Keep reading if you want to know why.

### Edutec, An Educational Project At Citilab
Eductec is a research group basically focused in studying how to teach computer science and technology, especially to children. At Edutec, they work with graphic programming [languages](http://edutec.citilab.eu/) – such as [Berkeley Snap](http://snap.berkeley.edu/ 'Berkeley Snap') -  to help kids and teenagers learn programming avoiding entry barriers such as syntax errors, keyword memorization, etc., that textual programming languages have.

Bernat is a programmer and an educator at Edutec, and his main motivation to do what he does is sharing his passion about technology as well as enabling early adoption of it by the youngest ones.

### How SnappyCity uses APItools
One of the cool things Edutec has recently been working on is SnappyCity, a bridge between the Berkeley Snap and the [iCity](http://www.icityproject.eu/ 'iCity'). The iCity is a platform that unifies a few sensor APIs from Barcelona and other cities.

APItools is the proxy that SnappyCity uses to connect to the iCity platform. ‘Before we found out about APItools we had our own server’ – Bernat says. ‘We have about 150 kids using the app, and we use APItools cloud version so we don’t have to maintain a server, plus I don’t have to worry about security, scalability, and stability.’

SnappyCity uses APITools to authenticate with the iCity platform, and also to apply some modifications to the information retrieved by the iCity API.

### Time To Have Some Fun!
I remember those afternoons when I would wait for my dad to get home and play [Gorillas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game) 'Gorillas') with me. Fun times. I wish we had known about these type of initiatives :) [Check it out](http://snappycity.citilab.eu 'SnappyCity'), time to have some fun! [snappycity.citilab.eu]
