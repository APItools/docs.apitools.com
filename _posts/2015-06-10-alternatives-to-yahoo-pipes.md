Just a few days ago [Yahoo! announced they’re going to shut down Pipes](http://pipes.yqlblog.net/post/120705592639/pipes-end-of-life-announcement). The service will be officially discontinued on August 30th, 2015. That means users will no longer be able to create new Pipes after that date and the existing ones will stop working on September 30th.

Yahoo! Pipes was probably one of the first services – in 2007 – created to help built data mashups, providing a visual interface to easily combine external web API services. An example would be to match ride coordinates from Uber against Google Maps API to show routes in a map.

A lot of things have happened since 2007 and luckily for us there are other services out there today which serve a similar purpose. So if you’re looking for alternatives to Yahoo! Pipes you’re in the right place, just keep reading.

#### Life After Pipes With APItools

Some of our users have started exploring using APItools and its middleware sharing platform for their API mashups. The main features are:

- You can combine as many web API services as you want / need to
- Flexibility to integrate with any web API service or platform 
- Absolute control of the integration
- Web or mobile
- Being able to re-use middleware modules created and shared by other users
- It’s free!

We have experimented with it ourselves and created a few mashups using multiple APIs like the following: [Slack bot for Uber ride price estimations](https://docs.apitools.com/uber/bots/slack/2015/01/22/slack-uber-get-uber-estimation-prices-before-you-leave-the-office.html 'Slack bot for Uber ride price estimations'), an [air quality bot for Slack using Breezometer](https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2015/04/08/air-quality-bot-for-slack-with-breezometer-.html 'air quality bot for Slack using Breezometer'), or a [timeline for survey responses with Typeform and Cardstreams](https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2015/06/01/how-to-create-timelines-using-cardstream-and-typeform-apis.html 'timeline for survey responses with Typeform and Cardstreams'). 

Sounds like fun? [Give it a swirl!](https://apitools.com/ 'Try out APItools')

#### Other Alternatives

Two other very popular services are IFTT and Zapier. Compared to APItools they provide pre-built integrations but on the other hand they offer less control of the pipes.

- [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/ 'IFTT') (If This Then That). Addressed to end users and completely free. It has integrations with most popular services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, Dropbox…). 
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/ 'Zapier').  It aims to help companies integrate apps and platforms and although it has a free tier, their services aren’t free.
