As promised, we’ve made available backup files to download services data from your APItools cloud traffic monitors.

Soon APItools' cloud traffic monitors will no longer be available from apitools.com. 

Migrating to APItools on-premise is easy, just [follow these steps](/docs/on-premise/#how-to-migrate-apitools-cloud-to-on-premise). You can deploy on Debian (recommended), Vagrant, Red Hat, or Docker.

And soon we'll be providing new deployment options, so stay tuned!

If you have questions, please [get in touch](mailto:support@apitools.com).
