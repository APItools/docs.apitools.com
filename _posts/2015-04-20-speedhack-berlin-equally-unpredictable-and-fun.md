As organizers of the [API Strategy & Practice Conference](http://apistrat.com/ 'API Strategy & Practice Conference'), [3scale](http://www.3scale.net/ '3scale') and [APItools](http://apitools.com/ 'APItools') have been part of the [Speedhack](http://speedhack.io/ 'Speedhack') since it was held for the first time in Chicago. After Chicago it came Paris, and next week the third edition of this particular hackathon – keep reading, you’ll see why we say it’s ‘particular’ -- will be held in Berlin (April 26th). And our very own [Nicolas Grenié](https://twitter.com/picsoung 'Nicolas Grenié') will be hosting the event again.
 
The Speedhack is one of our favorite hackathons mostly because it’s equally unpredictable and fun. What we mean by that is, for example, this email we got from one of the participant teams in Chicago. We didn’t have a separate ticket for the Speedhack back then (we do now, [participating in the Speedhack is free](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apidays-berlin-apistrat-europe-2015-tickets-15401044940?access=SPEEDHACKBERLIN 'Grab a free ticket for the speedHack Berlin') ), and they kindly requested to be given a couple of tickets:

<img src="/images/quote-mark.gif" width="60px;">*<span style="color:grey;">Hi, I am a Chicago student and I came across your hackathon happening tomorrow. I would love to attend along with my brother, as we are both really interested in the concept. However, the cost is way to high for us, considering we will not attend the rest of the conference. We would very much be able to participate and we promise it’ll be totally worth it -- especially since we will perform a  song and will be wearing costumes. Is there a way we could get a couple of tickets just for the hackathon? Thank you!</span>*

How could we say no? Obviously we said yes. And what was our surprise when they not only attended dressed up in costumes but also played an ukulele song… and they were not they only ones! We had lots of fun, and it is going to happen again in Berlin next week. Want to be part of it? [Check out this video to see more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfoT8hi_ruE 'SpeedHack Chicago').

**Algolia**, **APIdaze**, **Context.io**, **Cronofy**, **Google**, **Stamplay**, **Streamdata.io**, **Twilio** and **Twitter** will be the ones proposing the challenges to the participants this time, so if you’re participating, not a bad idea to [check out their APIs first](http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/speedhack-3-is-coming-to-berlin/) ;)

The Speedhack is all about solving code challenges… fast! If you’re an APItools user, you already know how valuable APItools can be in this type of situations. If not, give it a try, [check out some of the things that APItools can help you with at a hackathon](https://docs.apitools.com/docs/hackathons/ 'APItools for hackathons').

See you in Berlin? Happy Hacking!
