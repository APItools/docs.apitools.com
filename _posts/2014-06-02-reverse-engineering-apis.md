Last Friday we were at [APIdays Mediterranea](http://mediterranea.apidays.io/ 'APIdays Mediterranea') where [Raimon](https://github.com/kidd) and [Michal](https://github.com/mikz) from our team shared some insights on the Sonos and Bicing APIs while showcasing [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools'):

- Discovering a 'hidden API' with Sonos + APItools
- API aggregation made easy
