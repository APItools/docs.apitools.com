In our mission to promote adoption of APIs all over the world our hacker in residence, [Nicolas Grenié (@picsoung)](https://twitter.com/picsoung '@picsoung on Twitter'), is going to be travelling quite a bit these next few weeks: Paris, Berlin and Madrid. Part of it is a big initiative we've joined in Europe, Hack4Europe, and we're going to be present at some of their kick off events as well as providing mentoring and free access to APItools. If you happen to be in Paris this week, check out these couple of events below and join us to talk about startups and APIs.
