Today [Nginx](http://nginx.org/ 'NGINX') announced that it is the number one web server for the top 10,000 busiest websites in the world. At [3SCALE](http://www.3scale.net/ '3SCALE') we've been using [Redis](http://redis.io/ 'Redis') and NGINX for a while, so when we started working on [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools'), we thought it was a great opportunity to reuse a common strong core, while extending it to meet some very specific needs.

But we don’t just use NGINX  - we push it to the limits. While it's common that NGINX is used as a reverse proxy server or as a web server, it is a bit less common to use it for both tasks at the same time. That is exactly the case with APItools. Stay tuned for a blog post on how APItools uses NGINX as an intelligent proxy and web server simultaneously. 

“NGINX focuses on being a high performance and scalable webserver"- said Gus Robertson, CEO of Nginx, Inc. That, combined with Lua ([OpenResty](http://openresty.org/ 'OpenResty')) happens to be blazingly fast for inline server operations, blowing JavaScript away (which would have been the other choice).

Congratulations Nginx for reaching this milestone, and so glad to be included in those percentages with with 3scale and APItools!
