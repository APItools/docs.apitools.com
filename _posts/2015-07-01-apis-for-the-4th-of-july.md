The [4th of July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States) '4th of July') - a big day in the United States when Americans celebrate the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring independence from Great Britain - it's just around the corner. For those of you in the US or who just want an excuse to built another cool app ;-), here's a blog post to help you with it.

Maybe you're thinking in live sharing your party with friends who can't be there, in meeting new people, in finding fireworks around you,... If that's the case, we'd like to suggest a few ideas too: learning about the festivity, finding local events in your city, or coming up with the best recipes to prepare amazing food for your guests. There are APIs for all those things, and we've put together a list for you to create the most amazing apps.

####History 
First things first, let's learn about the history of this celebration.

- [The U.S. Open Data APIs](https://www.data.gov/ 'Data.gov APIs'). The U.S. Open Data site offers access to many datasets via APIs. You can search here what documents and [datasets](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset 'Data.gov datasets') are available or also access to their API directly.
- [Google books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started 'Google books API'). Or just find books - these old good friends of ours - to read about the history of this such an important day.

####Events And Celebrations
Find fireworks, parties, concerts and more being held in your city. These are two of our favorite APIs.

- [Meetup API](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/ 'Meetup API'). Specially good for local celebrations.
- [Eventbrite API](http://developer.eventbrite.com/ 'Eventbrite API'). For all sorts of events.

####Food And Drinks
A celebration is not the same without proper food and drinks specially designed for the occasion. 

- [Yummly API](https://developer.yummly.com/ 'Yummly API'). Find some [4th of July recipes](http://www.yummly.com/recipes/fourth-of-july 'Yummly 4th of July recipes') using Yummly's API. You may want to add Instacart to the mix (the do have an integration already) and push the ingredients you're going to need to your shopping list.
- [Foodpairing API](http://developer.foodpairing.com/#api 'Foodpairing API'). And beverage pairings!  ... and make your app even more awesome suggesting pairings with the help of the Foodpairing API. We're loving it already.

We hope you all have a fantastic 4th of July!
