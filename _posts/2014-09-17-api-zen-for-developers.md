At [3scale](http://www.3scale.net/ '3scale') – and at [APItools](https://www.apitools.com/ 'APItools!') – we believe there's a zen path to distributed systems. Our mission is not only to help people build better APIs, we are also all about making app developers lives easier.

If you missed Steven Wilmott's talk, 3scale CEO, about APIs, pains that come with app development, and how to ease them at [API World](http://apiworld.co/ 'API World') earlier today, check out the slides.
