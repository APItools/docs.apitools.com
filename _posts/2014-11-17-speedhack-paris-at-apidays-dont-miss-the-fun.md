After the SpeedHack at [APIStrat Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php 'APIStrat Chicago'), our friends from [APIdays](http://speedhack.io/ 'APIDays Paris') are taking the SpeedHack concept to France and more especifically to Paris. The SpeedHack Paris will be held during APIDays Paris on December 3rd. If you’re in Europe, make sure don’t miss this awesome event. It’s going to be A LOT of FUN.

8 APIs will dare participants with 8 different challenges to be solved in 3 hours. [APItools](https://www.apitools.com/ 'APItools') will be there one more time with one of the challenges. We can’t tell you what it is yet, but we certainly know the whole experience is going to be worth it. Just see it for yourself, this is what happened at the SpeedHack in Chicago back in September:

There were costumes:
