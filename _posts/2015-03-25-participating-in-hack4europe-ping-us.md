[Hack4Europe](http://hack4europe.com/ 'Hack4Europe') is the biggest European hackathon and at [3scale](http://www.3scale.net/ '3scale') and [APItools](http://apitools.com/ 'APItools') we’re pumped to have been invited to be part of it.

[APItools is participating](http://www.hackateam.com/en/challenges/hack4europe/pages/apis 'APItools at Hack4Europe') both offering mentorship to Hack4Europe hackers ([@picsoung](https://twitter.com/picsoung 'Nicolas on Twitter') is your man if you’re looking for help!) and answering any questions that they have regarding APItools. We will also give out 3 drones to the team that uses APItools in the best possible way!
