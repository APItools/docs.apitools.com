## DevTalks
On Friday 05/09 the event will kick off with a keynote on how brands and startups can effectively work together to achieve mutually-beneficial success, and will follow with more talks on advertisement, finance, music, Internet of Things and wearables, featuring speakers from [Tech City UK](http://www.techcityuk.com/ 'Tech City UK'), [shift2020](http://shift2020.com/ 'shift2020'), [TechStarts](http://www.techstars.com/ 'TechStars'), [Ogilvy Labs](http://www.ogilvydo.com/ 'Ogilvy Labs')- see complete [list of speakers here](http://thedeveloperlab.com/devevents/upcoming-events/devlab-live/speakers/)-, and including Manfred Bortenschlager from 3scale who will talk about the power of APIs and how APIs fuel mobile apps and wearables and are seen as one of the main drivers behind the Internet-of-Things vision. For (big) brands, APIs can be leveraged to increase reach and awareness or open up new revenue channels. For *bright minds*, APIs can be leveraged to easily increase functionality and attractiveness of an app by integrating with brands.

## Hackathon
On Saturday and Sunday (05/10- 05/11) come build and present a prototype to win cash prizes and the opportunity of working with the brands after the event to **take your idea to the next level**. In three months, the winners will be able to present their ideas back to the community for feedback, and potential investment in anticipation of market launch.

[Don't forget to sign up for APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools'), still in private beta, but we'll be giving access to everyone participating in the DevLab LIVE hackathon! 

Use APItools to quickly check out a few APIs and figure out how they work before starting your hackathon project, and then to easily test and debug your apps' API traffic. By proxing the API calls you will also be able to transform those calls. Check out an example of what you can do in this blog post that Nicolas, 3scale's hacker in residence, wrote a few weeks ago after BattleHack. If you have questions **shoot us an email** to [support at apitools](mailto:support@apitools.com).
