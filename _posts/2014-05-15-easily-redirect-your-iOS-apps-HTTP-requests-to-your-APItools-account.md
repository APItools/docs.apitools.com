If you are an iOS developer you may be interested in checking [JSTAPIToolsURLProtocol](https://github.com/JaviSoto/JSTAPIToolsURLProtocol 'JSTAPIToolsURLProtocol'). It is a protocol that [@Javi](https://twitter.com/javi 'Javi on Twitter'), iOS developer at [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/  'Pebble'), built to redirect some of the HTTP(s) requests your iOS applications make to your [APItools](https://www.apitools.com/, 'APItools')  account.

Many of today’s mobile applications integrate multiple APIs - and not only third party APIs - most often internal ones. One of the many useful things you can use APItools for is to proxy mobile apps API traffic through it to make your life easier when it comes to testing and debugging in dev environments.

Thank you Javi!
