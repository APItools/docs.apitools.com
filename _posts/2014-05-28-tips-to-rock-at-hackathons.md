Yesterday at [APIcon](https://eegeventsite.secure.force.com/apicon/ 'APIcon'), and just in time for the hackahton, we delivered a workshop on how to save some time (and energy!) at hackathons by using [APItools](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools').

[Nicolas](https://twitter.com/picsoung '@picsoung'), our hacker in residence at [3scale](http://3scale.net/ '3scale') - if you've been in a hackathon in San Francisco lately, there's a big chance you've ran into him :) - and I, shared some tips and tricks to make the most of APItools at hackathons, including:

- Dealing with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Twitter authentication
- Proxying mobile HTTP(s) requests
- Converting data formats
- Caching responses to avoid having to deal with rate limits

Here are the slides:

Thank you all who attended for doing so and for the great feedback!

APItools is in private beta, [invitations can be requested here](https://www.apitools.com 'APItools').
